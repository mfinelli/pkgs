# netdata

Install [netdata](https://netdata.cloud).

The official documentation generally suggests installing using their script,
but that isn't very repeatable or ansible-friendly so I've reverse engineered
some, checked the official ansible playbook some, and also followed the
instructions from their
[apt repository](https://packagecloud.io/netdata/netdata).
